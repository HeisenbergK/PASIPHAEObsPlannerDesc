abstract = {Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) is a wide-field imaging camera on the prime focus of the 8.2m Subaru telescope on the summit of Maunakea in Hawaii. A team of scientists from Japan, Taiwan and Princeton University is using HSC to carry out a 300-night multi-band imaging survey of the high-latitude sky. The survey includes three layers: the Wide layer will cover 1400 deg{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} in five broad bands ({\$}grizy{\$}), with a {\$}5\backslash,\backslashsigma{\$} point-source depth of {\$}r \backslashapprox 26{\$}. The Deep layer covers a total of 26{\~{}}deg{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} in four fields, going roughly a magnitude fainter, while the UltraDeep layer goes almost a magnitude fainter still in two pointings of HSC (a total of 3.5 deg{\$}{\^{}}2{\$}). Here we describe the instrument, the science goals of the survey, and the survey strategy and data processing. This paper serves as an introduction to a special issue of the Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, which includes a large number of technical and scientific papers describing results from the early phases of this survey.},

abstract = {The INT Photometric Halpha Survey of the Northern Galactic Plane (IPHAS) is a 1800 square degrees CCD survey of the northern Milky Way spanning the latitude range -5 {\textless} b {\textless} +5 (degrees) and reaching down to r' {\~{}} 20 (10-sigma). It may increase the number of known northern emission line sources by an order of magnitude. Representative observations and an assessment of point-source data from IPHAS, now underway, are presented. The data obtained are Wide Field Camera images in Halpha narrow-band, and Sloan r' and i' broad-band, filters. We simulate IPHAS (r' - Halpha, r' - i') point-source colours using a spectrophotometric library of stellar spectra and available filter transmission profiles: this gives expected colours for (i) solar-metallicity stars, without Halpha emission, and (ii) emission line stars. Comparisons with Aquila field observations show that simulated normal star colours reproduce the data well for spectral types earlier than M. Spectroscopic follow-up of a Cepheus field confirms that sources lying above the main stellar locus in the (r' - Halpha, r' - i') plane are emission line objects, with very few failures. Examples of Halpha deficit objects -- a white dwarf and a carbon star -- are shown to be readily distinguished by their IPHAS colours. The role IPHAS can play in studies of nebulae is discussed briefly, and illustrated by a continuum-subtracted mosaic image of the SNR, Shajn 147. The final catalogue of IPHAS point sources will contain photometry on {\~{}}80 million objects. (abridged)},

abstract = {The recently initiated Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey aims to map 7000 square degrees of the high galactic latitude sky visible from Arecibo, providing a HI line spectral database covering the redshift range between -1600 km/s and 18,000 km/s with 5 km/s resolution. Exploiting Arecibo's large collecting area and small beam size, ALFALFA is specifically designed to probe the faint end of the HI mass function in the local universe and will provide a census of HI in the surveyed sky area to faint flux limits, making it especially useful in synergy with wide area surveys conducted at other wavelengths. ALFALFA will also provide the basis for studies of the dynamics of galaxies within the Local and nearby superclusters, will allow measurement of the HI diameter function, and enable a first wide-area blind search for local HI tidal features, HI absorbers at z {\textless} 0.06 and OH megamasers in the redshift range 0.16 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.25. Although completion of the survey will require some five years, public access to the ALFALFA data and data products will be provided in a timely manner, thus allowing its application for studies beyond those targeted by the ALFALFA collaboration. ALFALFA adopts a two-pass, minimum intrusion, drift scan observing technique which samples the same region of sky at two separate epochs to aid in the discrimination of cosmic signals from noise and terrestrial interference. Survey simulations, which take into account large scale structure in the mass distribution and incorporate experience with the ALFA system gained from tests conducted during its commissioning phase, suggest that ALFALFA will detect on the order of 20,000 extragalactic HI line sources out to z=0.06, including several hundred with HI masses of less than 10{\^{}}{\{}7.5{\}} msun.},
